- **Aphasia:** Any impairment in language abilities.
- Two primary types: Wernicke's and Broca's aphasia.

### Wernicke's Aphasia

- Located in the left hemisphere of the brain.
- Receives input from auditory and visual areas.
- Responsible for language comprehension.
- **Symptoms:**
    - Fluent speech but difficulty understanding language.
    - Inability to comprehend both spoken and written language.
    - General language impairment, not specific to hearing.
- **Impact:** Difficult to communicate with individuals with Wernicke's aphasia due to their inability to understand.

### Broca's Aphasia

- Located in the left hemisphere of the brain.
- Responsible for language production.
- **Symptoms:**
    - Difficulty producing speech despite understanding language.
    - Impairment in signing for individuals who use sign language.
    - Not a motor impairment but a language production impairment.
- **Impact:** Challenges in expressing oneself clearly.
- **Note:** Individuals with either Wernicke's or Broca's aphasia may experience some impairment in the opposite area.

### Embodied Cognition and Aphasia

- Understanding language involves motor circuits related to speech production.
- Damage to Broca's area can impair comprehension due to the inability to engage in motor actions associated with speech.

### Example: Poetic Expression of Broca's Aphasia

- A poem written by the lecturer's aunt after a stroke demonstrates the challenges of Broca's aphasia.
- The poem conveys clear meaning despite grammatical errors and difficulty expressing thoughts verbally.

**Conclusion:**

- Aphasia is a complex condition affecting both language comprehension and production.
- Understanding the different types of aphasia is crucial for effective communication and support for individuals with these impairments.

**Additional Notes:**

- The brain's ability to recover from stroke is often significant, with many individuals regaining full language function.
