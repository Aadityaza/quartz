This note covers standardized terms used to describe brain structures and their relative locations in MRI research.

**Key Terminology:**

- **Anterior/Posterior:** Front and back of the brain, respectively.
- **Superior/Inferior:** Top and bottom of the brain, respectively.
- **Medial/Lateral:** Towards or away from the center of the brain, respectively.
- **Rostral/Caudal:** Terms used in animals, with rostral being the front and caudal being the back. 
- **Dorsal/Ventral**:  Terms used in animals, with dorsal being the top and ventral being the bottom.

**Planes of Orientation:**

- **Frontal/Coronal Plane:** Divides the brain front-to-back.
- **Transverse/Axial Plane:** Horizontal plane, dividing the brain top-to-bottom.
- **Sagittal Plane/Midline Sagittal Plane:** Vertical plane dividing the brain left-to-right through the center (midline) or the nose.

**MRI Image Conventions:**

- **Radiological Convention:** Left side of the image corresponds to the right side of the brain (as if looking at the person).
- **Neurological Convention:** Left side of the image corresponds to the left side of the brain (as if standing behind the person).
- **Fiduciary Marker:** A marker placed on the right side of the brain during MRI to clarify left and right sides in the image.

**Additional Terms:**

- **Proximal:** Closer to the point of attachment.
- **Distal:** Further from the point of attachment.
- **Ipsilateral:** On the same side of the brain.
- **Contralateral:** On the opposite side of the brain.
- **Oblique Plane:** A plane angled relative to the horizontal or vertical planes.
