## Lecture Notes: Rods and Cones

**The Two Types of Photoreceptors**

- Our eyes can see across a vast range of light conditions, from very dim (scotopic) to bright sunlight (photopic).
- This ability is achieved by having two distinct types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.
- Rods are highly sensitive to light and function best in scotopic conditions.
- Cones are less sensitive to light but provide high-acuity vision and color perception, crucial for photopic conditions.
- There's an overlap (mesopic) where both rods and cones operate.

**Structure and Function of Rods and Cones**

- Rods and cones differ in shape: rods resemble a rod, while cones look like flattened structures.
- Both contain rhodopsin, the light-sensitive molecule, but its location differs.
- In rods, rhodopsin resides within sacs inside the cell.
- In cones, rhodopsin is positioned directly on membranes within the outer segment.
- This difference in structure affects their response time: rods have a slower response due to the signaling cascade triggered by rhodopsin.

**Key Differences Between Rods and Cones**

- **Sensitivity:** Rods are far more sensitive to light than cones, allowing us to see in dim light.
- **Color vision:** Cones come in three types, each responding best to a specific wavelength of light. This enables color perception, absent in rod vision.
- **Spatial Acuity:** Rods gather information from a larger area of the visual field, leading to poor detail perception. Cones, with their smaller receptive fields, provide high-acuity vision for seeing fine details.

**Importance of Cones**

- While color vision is significant, the primary function of cones is to enable high-acuity vision, crucial for tasks like reading.
- Cones allow us to see details that rods cannot detect due to their larger receptive fields.

**Next Up: Distribution of Rods and Cones**

- The lecture will explore the distribution of rods and cones across the retina, explaining how it relates to central vision.![[Pasted image 20240327132110.png]]
