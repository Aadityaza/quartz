**Neural Tube Closure Problems**

- Neural tube closure failure can lead to severe birth defects.
- Most severe defect: complete lack of closure (lethal in early pregnancy).

**Two Major Neural Tube Defects**

1. **Spina Bifida:** Posterior neuropore fails to close.

    - Consequences:
        - Exposed spinal cord (paralysis, loss of function).
        - Spinal cord pulling on brain (hydrocephalus, brain dysfunction).
        - Severity varies depending on opening size.
    - Treatment: Surgery (including prenatal intervention).
2. **Anencephaly:** Anterior neuropore fails to close.

    - Consequences:
        - Exposed brain (disintegrates over time).
        - Lethal condition (most die before or shortly after birth).

**Other Neural Tube Defects**

- **Encephalocele:**Â Neural tube defect occurring after day 28.
    - Cyst containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or CSF and brain tissue.
    - Prognosis depends on content (CSF has better outcome).
    - Treatment: Surgery.

**Preventing Neural Tube Defects**

- Neural tube closure occurs in the 4th week of pregnancy (often before pregnancy is known).
- Folate supplementation of grains:
    - Reduces occurrence by about 70%.
    - Not effective in all cases.
- Challenges:
    - Not all foods fortified with folate (e.g., gluten-free).
    - Dietary habits may not provide sufficient folate intake.

**Conclusion**

- Neural tube defects are serious but preventable in many cases.
- Folate supplementation has significantly reduced their occurrence.
- Further research needed to address remaining cases.
