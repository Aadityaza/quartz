**I. Importance of Steady Gaze**

- Gaze stability is crucial for maintaining a clear visual picture during head movements.
- Gaze is determined by both head and eye orientation.
- The vestibular system plays a key role in keeping gaze steady.

**II. The Vestibuloocular Reflex (VOR)**

- The VOR is a reflex that keeps gaze stable during head movements.
- It acts very quickly due to the fast response time of the vestibular system.
- VOR dysfunction can cause the world to appear shaky during head movements.

**III. Observing the VOR**

- You can observe the VOR by focusing on your finger and shaking your head side-to-side. Your finger should remain in focus.
- Moving your finger back and forth will not activate the VOR as effectively, and your focus will be less stable.

**IV. Importance of the VOR**

- The VOR is essential because the visual system is too slow to react effectively to head movements.
- Without the VOR, our vision would be blurry during any head movement.

**V. Example: Taking a Picture on a Boat**

- Imagine trying to take a picture on a boat without the VOR. The swaying of the boat would constantly disrupt your aim.

**VI. The VOR in Action**

- During head movements, the VOR signals the eyes to move in the opposite direction to maintain a steady gaze.

**VII. Next Steps**

- The lecture will explore the neural circuitry of the VOR.
