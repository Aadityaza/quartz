## Lecture Notes: Sleep-Wake Cycle Regulation

### Sleep-Wake Homeostasis

- **Sleep pressure:** Builds up over time, promoting sleep. Decreases with sleep.
- **Circadian rhythm:** Internal biological clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Promotes wakefulness.

### Hypothalamic Control

- **Sleep-promoting area:** Located near the optic chiasm.
- **Wakefulness-promoting area:** Located posteriorly in the hypothalamus.
- **Antagonistic interaction:** The two areas work in opposition to regulate sleep-wake states.
- **Disorders:** Lesions in either area can lead to excessive sleepiness or insomnia.

### Factors Influencing Sleep-Wake Cycle

- **Sickness behavior:** Increases sleep drive, promoting more sleep.
- **External stimuli:** Can temporarily override sleep pressure (e.g., staying awake for important tasks).
- **Circadian rhythm:** Primarily influenced by light-dark cycles.
- **Superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN):** Brain region responsible for regulating circadian rhythms.

### Challenges and Future Directions

- **Jet lag:** Disruption of circadian rhythm due to rapid time zone changes.
- **Sleep disorders:** Insomnia, excessive sleepiness, and other sleep-related problems.
- **Research needs:** Further investigation into sleep mechanisms and development of effective treatments for sleep disorders.
