### Bladder Anatomy and Function

- **Detrusor muscle:** Smooth muscle responsible for bladder contraction.
    - Innervated by parasympathetic neurons in the sacral spinal cord.
    - Involuntary control.
- **External urethral sphincter:** Skeletal muscle controlling urine outflow.
    - Always contracted except during urination.
    - Voluntary control.

### Neural Control of Voiding

- **Voiding center:** Located in the dorsal pons.
- **Process:**
    - Bladder fills to sufficient volume.
    - Voluntary decision to void is made.
    - Parasympathetic neurons stimulate detrusor muscle contraction.
    - Voluntary relaxation of external urethral sphincter.

### Bladder Pressure and Volume

- Bladder pressure is not directly proportional to volume.
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation affects bladder elasticity.
- Normal bladder filling involves a gradual increase in volume with minimal pressure increase.
- Urge to void occurs at a certain pressure threshold.
- Nervousness can increase bladder sensitivity, leading to earlier urge.
- Sleep involves mechanisms to maintain low bladder pressure, preventing nighttime awakenings.

### Conclusion

- Urinary voiding is a complex process involving multiple muscles and neural pathways.
- Voluntary control and bladder elasticity play crucial roles in maintaining continence and initiating urination.
- Factors like stress and sleep can influence bladder function.
