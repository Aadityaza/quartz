**Introduction**

- Aphasia is a language disorder that has been recognized for centuries.
- Historical descriptions date back to 1690, highlighting difficulties finding words and jumbled speech.

**Early Insights**

- A physician in 1843 described his own experience with aphasia, emphasizing the inability to find words despite having clear thoughts.
- Marc Dax (1836) proposed a link between aphasia and the left hemisphere of the brain, although his work gained less recognition.

**Broca's Contribution**

- Paul Broca, a French neurologist, is credited with discovering left hemisphere involvement in aphasia.
- He studied patients with Broca's aphasia, characterized by limited speech output but relatively good comprehension.
- Broca's area, located in the left frontal lobe near the motor cortex, is implicated in this type of aphasia.

**Communication and Recovery**

- People with aphasia can still communicate, especially with familiar individuals, using facial expressions, tone of voice, and remaining language skills.
- Aphasia can be frustrating, but recovery is possible, as shown in the case of the lecturer's aunt and Jill Bolte Taylor.

**Next Steps**

- The following lecture will explore the brain circuits responsible for language production.

**Additional Notes**

- The lecture mentions a picture of "Tan," a patient with Broca's aphasia, who had a lesion in the left frontal lobe.
- A poem written by the lecturer's aunt after her stroke with aphasia provides a personal perspective on the experience.
