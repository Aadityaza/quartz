## Neurons and Communication: From Resting to Action

This lecture builds on the concept of resting membrane potential and introduces the action potential:

**Resting Membrane Potential:**

- Neurons maintain a negative potential (around -65 mV) at rest.
- Small potential changes (up to 5 mV) can occur but die out quickly and are not suitable for long-distance communication.

**Action Potential:**

- Needed for long-distance communication due to the long distances neurons can span (e.g., from toe to brain).
- A large, all-or-nothing event with a rapid rise and fall in voltage (around 100 mV).
- Triggered by an influx of sodium ions into the cell, causing a positive charge increase.
- Allows communication over long distances without losing signal strength.

**Additional Notes:**

- Myelin acts as an insulator, further enabling efficient action potential propagation.
