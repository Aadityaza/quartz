**I. Introduction**

- The lecture dives into the **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** nervous systems.
- Both are **automatic** and target three tissue types: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands.

**II. Key Differences**

- **Function:**
    - **Sympathetic:** "Fight or flight" response (increased heart rate, pupil dilation, etc.)
    - **Parasympathetic:** "Rest and digest" response (decreased heart rate, pupil constriction, etc.)
- **Origin:**
    - **Sympathetic:** Thoracic spinal cord
    - **Parasympathetic:** Cranial nerves and sacral spinal cord (often called craniosacral system)

**III. Examples of Opposing Actions**

- **Heart:** Sympathetic increases heart rate, parasympathetic decreases it.
- **Eyes:** Sympathetic dilates pupils, parasympathetic constricts them.

**IV. Exceptions to the "Opposing Actions" Rule**

- **Sacral parasympathetics and sympathetics in the bladder, colon, and sexual organs:**
    - **Bladder and colon:** Both systems have roles, but parasympathetic is crucial for elimination.
    - **Sexual organs:** Parasympathetic is important for arousal, while sympathetic is critical for climax.

**V. Unique Functions of the Sympathetic System**

- **Sweat glands:** Only innervated by the sympathetic system, responsible for sweating.
- **Piloerection (goosebumps):** Exclusively controlled by the sympathetic system.
- **Cutaneous blood vessels:** Sympathetic system controls constriction and dilation, impacting blood pressure.
- **Adrenal medulla:** Releases the stress hormone cortisol, solely innervated by the sympathetic system.

**VI. Clinical Example: Addison's Disease**

- Caused by insufficient adrenal medulla function, leading to cortisol deficiency.
- Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, and weight loss.
- John F. Kennedy is a historical example of someone with Addison's disease.

**VII. Conclusion**

- The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems work together to maintain physiological balance.
- Understanding their individual functions and interactions is crucial in various physiological contexts.

**Key points:**

- The parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are located in the brainstem and sacral cord, while the sympathetic preganglionic neurons are located in the thoracic cord.
- Spinal cord injury can isolate the sacral cord, which is responsible for bladder function.
- When the sacral cord is isolated, it can no longer receive instructions from the brain and may cause bladder dyssynergia, a condition where the bladder contracts while the sphincter remains closed.
- Bladder dyssynergia is a common medical emergency following spinal cord injury.

**Additional details:**

- The sacral cord is responsible for executing bladder function, but it does not make the decision to void urine.
- Micturition (urination) requires both the contraction of the bladder (a parasympathetic effect) and the relaxation of the sphincter (a voluntary muscle controlled by the brain).
- In spinal cord injury, the bladder may contract but the sphincter will not relax due to the lack of communication between the brain and the sacral cord.
- This can lead to serious health problems if not addressed promptly.

**Interesting fact:**

- Eyelid movement can be used to assess wake-sleep cycles in individuals with spinal cord injury because the eyelid is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which remains intact in some cases.
