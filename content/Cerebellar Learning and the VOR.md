**The VOR: Keeping Your Gaze Steady**

- The VOR is a reflex that stabilizes your gaze during head movements.
- When you move your head, the VOR moves your eyes in the opposite direction to keep your eyes focused on a fixed point.
- This is important because the vestibular system (responsible for balance) is much faster than the visual system.

**Why is the VOR Important?**

- It allows you to see a clear image while your head is moving (e.g., reading on a train).
- The visual system is too slow to compensate for head movements on its own.

**Modulating the VOR Gain**

- The amount your eyes move with the VOR (gain) can be adjusted.
- When focusing on a near object, your eyes need to move more to maintain fixation compared to focusing on a distant object.
- The cerebellum (specifically the flocculus and nodulus) constantly adjusts the VOR gain to optimize gaze stability.

**Turning Off the VOR**

- In some situations, you don't want the VOR to oppose head movements.
- For example, if you want to look far to the side, you need to move your head and keep your eyes focused within the head (not following the head movement).
- The cerebellum can turn off the VOR or adjust the gain to zero.

**Clinical Applications**

- Testing the VOR is a common way to assess brain function in unconscious patients.
    - **Dolls' eyes:** If the VOR gain is fixed at 1 (eyes always move opposite to head movement), it suggests cerebellar damage.
    - **No VOR:** If the eyes move with the head, it suggests brain stem dysfunction.

**Additional Points**

- The cerebellum constantly adapts the VOR throughout the day.
- Changing glasses requires recalibrating the VOR, which is also controlled by the cerebellum.
