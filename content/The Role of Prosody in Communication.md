### Beyond Words - The Role of Prosody in Communication

This lecture builds on the previous one by discussing prosody and its role in understanding spoken language.

**Key Points:**

- **Prosody vs. Semantics:**
    - Prosody is the non-linguistic aspects of speech like pitch, tone, and rhythm.
    - Semantics refers to the literal meaning of words.
- **Brain Areas for Processing Language:**
    - Wernicke's area (left hemisphere) is crucial for understanding the semantic content of words.
    - Broca's area (left hemisphere) is responsible for speech production.
    - A mirror system exists in the right hemisphere:
        - An area responsible for understanding prosody.
        - An area responsible for producing prosody.
- **Importance of Prosody:**
    - Prosody conveys emotional tone and intent beyond the literal meaning of words.
    - Examples are given where the same words with different prosody can have opposite meanings ("good morning").
    - Damage to the right hemisphere can impact communication by affecting prosody, even if semantic understanding remains intact.

**Lecture takeaway:** Prosody is a vital part of communication, adding nuance and emotional context to spoken language. Damage to the brain areas responsible for prosody can significantly hinder communication.
