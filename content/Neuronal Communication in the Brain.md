This note discussed the fundamental principles of communication between neurons in the brain. 

**Neuronal Structure and Communication Theories:**
- Neurons are the processing units of the brain, consisting of dendrites, cell body, axons, and nerve endings.
- Two main theories exist regarding neuronal communication:
    - Reticular theory (Golgi): Neurons form a continuous network, connected directly.
    - Neuron doctrine (Cajal): Neurons are structurally independent, interacting through synapses (supported by electron microscopy).

**Types of Neurons:**

- Sensory neurons: Convert external stimuli to electrical signals.
- Interneurons: Process and relay information within the brain.
- Motor neurons: Convert processed signals into muscle/gland movements.

**Electrical and Chemical Communication:**

- Neurons have ion channels and pumps maintaining a resting potential across the membrane.
- Communication occurs at synapses, where electrical signals are converted to chemical signals.
![[Pasted image 20240501194204.png|400]]
- **Communication Mechanisms:**
    - Neurons communicate through synapses, the connection points between nerve endings and dendrites.
    - Communication involves both electrical and chemical signals:
        - Electrical signals:
            - Established by ion channels and pumps, creating a resting state potential.
            - Action potentials (electrochemical pulses) travel along axons.
        - Chemical signals:
            - Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal.
            - Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, influencing its potential.
- **Synaptic Transmission:**
    1. Calcium influx triggers synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane.
    2. Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft.
    3. Neurotransmitters bind to postsynaptic receptors, opening or closing ion channels.
    4. Influx or efflux of ions alters the postsynaptic membrane potential.
    5. Sufficient depolarization triggers an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.
    6. Used synaptic vesicles are retrieved and recycled.
- **Postsynaptic Effects:**
    - Excitatory stimulation (EPSPs) depolarize the membrane, increasing the likelihood of action potential generation.
    - Inhibitory stimulation hyperpolarizes the membrane, making it harder to reach the action potential threshold.
    - Summation of EPSPs can be necessary to reach the threshold.

**Recording Neuronal Activity:**
- Electrodes placed inside or outside neurons measure voltage changes.
- Intracellular recordings reflect voltage changes within the cell.
- Extracellular recordings capture local field potentials due to activity in the surrounding neuronal environment.
- Local field potentials (LFPs): Extracellular recordings reflect activity of a local neuronal network.
- Importance of LFPs: Understanding the basis of MRI signal generation.

**Key Points:**

- Neurons communicate through a combination of electrical and chemical signals.
- Synapses are the primary sites of communication between neurons.
- Different types of neurons have specialized functions.
- Local field potentials are crucial for understanding brain function (e.g., MRI).

There are wide variety of neurotransmitters with different functions (>50 identified).

**Categories of Neurotransmitters**
- **Excitatory:** Increase postsynaptic cell activity (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine).
- **Inhibitory:** Decrease postsynaptic cell activity (e.g., serotonin, GABA).
- **Modulatory:** Can be excitatory or inhibitory depending on context (e.g., dopamine).

**How Neurotransmitters Work**

- Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell.
- Binding can open or close ion channels, affecting cell firing.
- Glutamate example:
    - AMPA receptors: allow sodium influx for excitation.
    - NMDA receptors: allow calcium influx for learning and memory (Long-Term Potentiation).
    -![[Pasted image 20240509193842.png|400]]
- Drugs can mimic or block neurotransmitters.
    - Agonists: open channels (natural or artificial).
    - Antagonists: block channels (competitive or noncompetitive).

**Communication with the Body**
	![[Pasted image 20240509194041.png|300]]
- **Direct Innervation:**
    - Cranial nerves: Extend from brainstem to head and upper body.
    - Cortical spinal tracts: Carry sensory and motor information between brain and body via spinal cord.
		 ![[Pasted image 20240509194344.png|500]]
    
- **Hormonal Communication:**
    - Endocrine system: Network of glands releasing hormones.
    - Regulates physiological and behavioral functions (e.g., heart rate, mood).
    - Produced by glands in the endocrine system.
	- Travel through blood to target organs and influence physiological processes.
	- Examples: Adrenaline, various hormones from hypothalamus, pituitary, and pineal glands.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240509195107.png|300]]

**Example: Adrenaline and the Stress Response**
1. Adrenaline released by adrenal glands in response to danger.
2. Adrenaline activates sympathetic nervous system.
3. Sympathetic nervous system prepares body for "fight or flight" response (increased heart rate, respiration, etc.).
4. Adrenaline indirectly influences brain by binding to vagus nerve, releasing glutamate, and impacting memory regions.

**Blood-Brain Barrier**
- Protects the brain from toxins and bacteria.
- Only allows specific molecules, like oxygen and glucose, to pass through.
- Certain brain regions not protected by the blood-brain barrier produce hormones.

**Bidirectional Communication**
- Hormones can also send signals back to the brain from other organs.
- Example: Adrenaline triggers the "fight-or-flight" response via the nervous system.

**IV. Conclusion**

- Brain uses a complex interplay of neurotransmitters and hormones to communicate:    
    - Within itself
    - With the rest of the body
    - Receives feedback from the body
