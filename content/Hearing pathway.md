**Introduction to Sound Waves**

- Sound waves are waves of pressure.
- Two key components:
    - Frequency (Hertz): number of cycles per second
        - Speech: 250 Hz - 4000 Hz
        - Lower frequencies: Bass sounds (e.g., contrabassoon)
        - Higher frequencies: Treble sounds (e.g., piccolo)
    - Intensity (decibels): perceived loudness
        - 0 dB: Lowest detectable sound
        - Conversational speech: 60 dB
        - Modern world has many loud noises (e.g., traffic, leaf blowers)

**From Air to Fluid Waves**

- The ear needs to convert air waves (external ear) to fluid waves (inner ear).
- External ear funnels sound waves.
- Middle ear acts like a drum, transmitting vibrations to the inner ear.

**Auditory Pathway**

- The cochlea (inner ear) filled with fluid receives the vibrations.
- An auditory nerve carries the information to the brain.
- Information from both ears goes to both sides of the brain (bilateral).
- Hearing loss is usually due to problems in the ear, not the brain.

**Next Steps**

- The lecture will explore the external ear, middle ear, and inner ear in more detail.
- We will learn how these parts work together for hearing and how hearing loss can occur.
