Here are detailed lecture notes on strokes and other brain lesions based on the new transcript:

Title: Strokes and Other Brain Lesions

I. Strokes
   A. Types of Strokes
      1. Ischemic Stroke (90% of cases)
         - Lack of oxygen due to blocked blood vessel
      2. Hemorrhagic Stroke  
         - Ruptured blood vessel, bleeding into brain tissue
   B. Sudden Onset - Defining characteristic of strokes

   C. Effects Depend on Location
      1. Large vessel blockage → Massive effect on brain area it supplies
      2. Small vessel blockage → Minor/No noticeable symptoms  

   D. Causes of Blocked Vessels
      1. Atherosclerotic plaques
      2. Arteriovenous malformations

   E. Treatment Differences 
      1. Ischemic - Give blood thinners to restore flow
      2. Hemorrhagic - Blood thinners contraindicated, will worsen bleeding
      
   F. Need to Discriminate Stroke Type Without Imaging

   G. Neurological Effects Based on Stroke Location
      - Aphasia, body paralysis, vision loss etc.

II. Tissue Damage Around Stroke
    A. Ischemia/Hemorrhage → Neuron death in core region
    B. Treatment targets "penumbra" - at-risk surrounding neurons

III. Other Brain Lesions  
     A. Tumors
     ![[Pasted image 20240320192145.png]]
        - Can infiltrate brain, destroy neurons
        - More gradual onset than stroke
     B. Symptoms may appear suddenly after crossing threshold
