**I. How Common is Hearing Loss?**

- Hearing loss and deafness are surprisingly common, affecting up to 5% of the world's population.

**II. Causes of Hearing Loss**

- **Congenital Deafness:**
    - Caused by mutations in genes responsible for the intricate structure of the inner ear.
    - Examples: molecules for cochlear fluid, hair cell function etc.
    - Any mutation affecting these can lead to deafness or severe hearing impairment.
- **Medications:**
    - Certain chemotherapeutic drugs and antibiotics can be toxic to hair cells, causing hearing loss.

**III. Presbyacusis (Age-Related Hearing Loss)**

- Most common cause of hearing loss in adults.
- Caused by:
    - Loss of outer hair cells in the cochlea.
    - Inner hair cells (responsible for transmitting information to the brain) remain relatively intact.
    - This loss disrupts the cochlear amplifier, leading to significant hearing difficulties.
- Contributing factors:
    - Exposure to loud noises over time.

**IV. Impact of Presbyacusis**

- Hearing loss at high frequencies first.
- Speech becomes difficult to understand, especially sounds like "f," "s," and "th."
- Difficulty following conversations, particularly in noisy environments.

**V. Demonstration of Presbyacusis on Audiogram**

- Normal hearing threshold: 0 decibels across most frequencies.
- Presbyacusis: Relatively normal hearing at low frequencies, but significantly elevated thresholds (requiring much louder sounds) at high frequencies.
- High-frequency sounds crucial for understanding speech are most affected.

**VI. Progression of Presbyacusis**

- Over time, hearing loss can progress to lower and lower frequencies.
- This can lead to severe hearing impairment in older adults.
