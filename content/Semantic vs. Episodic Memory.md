### Declarative Memory: Two Types

- **Semantic memory:** General knowledge, facts, and concepts.
    - Examples: George Washington was the first president, the meaning of "multiple."
- **Episodic memory:** Personal experiences and events.
    - Examples: Autobiographical memories, specific events.

### Episodic to Semantic Shift

- **Storytelling and memory:** Repeated retelling of an episodic memory can transform it into a semantic memory.
- **Loss of detail:** Semantic memories lack the specific context and sensory information of episodic memories.
- **Example:** A family story about a child's mischievous behavior evolves from a detailed recollection to a shared anecdote.

**Key Points:**

- Semantic and episodic memories are distinct types of declarative memory.
- Episodic memories can degrade into semantic memories over time through repeated retelling.
