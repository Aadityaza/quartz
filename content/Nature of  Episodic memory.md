### Nature of Episodic Memory

- **Rich in Sensory Detail:** Episodic memories are characterized by vivid recall of sensory experiences associated with an event.
- **Personal and Contextual:** These memories are tied to specific personal experiences and their contexts.
- **Variability in Recall:** The ability to accurately recall details varies significantly between individuals.
- **Inaccuracy Over Time:** Memories are not static snapshots but rather reconstructions that can change and evolve.

### Example: The 1989 Earthquake

- **Sensory Recall:** The lecturer vividly recalls the sounds, sights, and feelings experienced during the 1989 earthquake.
- **Limited Detail:** Despite strong overall memory, specific details like clothing or weather conditions are less clear.

### Enhancing Memory Recall

- **Focus on Sensory Details:** A technique suggested by a memoir writer involves mentally reconstructing a scene, focusing on sensory elements like colors, smells, and sounds to improve recall.

### Memory Distortion and Change

- **Ulric Neisser's Research:** A study on the Challenger disaster demonstrated significant discrepancies in memory recall over time.
- **Personal Anecdote:** The lecturer shares a personal example of a distorted memory related to the Pearl Harbor attack, highlighting the unreliability of memory.
- **Interpretation and Reconstruction:** Memories are not exact recordings but are subject to interpretation and modification over time.

### Conclusion

Episodic memories are complex and dynamic mental constructs. While they can be rich in sensory detail, they are also prone to inaccuracies and changes over time. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for appreciating the limitations of human memory.
