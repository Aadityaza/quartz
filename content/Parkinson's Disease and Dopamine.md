### Parkinson's Disease and Dopamine

- **Cause:** Degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain.
- **Dopamine's role:**
    - Provides "motor oil" for movement (tonic function).
    - Facilitates the direct pathway for movement initiation and selection.
- **Symptoms:**
    - Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement.
    - Difficulty initiating movements.
    - Loss of automatic movements (habits).
    - Freezing: Inability to move despite intention.

### The Impact of Dopamine Loss

- **90% neuron loss:** Onset of Parkinson's symptoms.
- **Less than 90% neuron loss:** No noticeable symptoms.
- **Dopamine depletion:** Leads to difficulty in initiating and controlling movement due to lack of "motor oil" and impaired direct pathway function.

### Parkinson's and Movement

- **Movement as a habit:** People with Parkinson's lose the ability to perform habitual movements easily.
- **Deliberate movement:** Every movement becomes a conscious and effortful process.
- **Mental effort:** Required to initiate and execute even simple actions.

### Summary

Parkinson's disease is primarily caused by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Dopamine is essential for smooth and efficient movement. Its depletion results in difficulty initiating movement, slowness, and loss of habitual actions. Understanding the role of dopamine in movement is crucial for comprehending the challenges faced by individuals with Parkinson's.
