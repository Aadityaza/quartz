- The cerebellum can be divided into three main regions:
    - **Vermis:** Located in the center, controls midline movements like walking, standing, and speech.
    - **Paravermis:** Flanking the vermis, controls movements of arms and legs.
    - **Lateral Lobes:** The largest part, function is less understood but might be involved in:
        - Motor learning of new skills.
        - Non-motor functions like language and social interaction.

**Additional details:**

- **Flocculus:** A smaller region critical for eye movement coordination (stabilizing gaze and smooth pursuit).
- **Cerebellar tumors:** Location of the tumor can determine the affected function:
    - Vermis tumors impact walking, balance, and speech.
    - Paravermis tumors affect reaching movements.
    - Lateral lobe tumors might have subtle effects due to their less defined role.

**Unresolved questions:**

- The exact function of the lateral lobes remains an active area of research.
- The cerebellum's potential role in non-motor functions like language and social processing is still debated.

**Conclusion:**

Understanding cerebellar topography helps explain how damage to specific regions can lead to different movement problems. While the vermis and paravermis have well-defined roles, the functions of the lateral lobes are still being explored.
