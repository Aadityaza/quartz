## Lecture Notes: Thermoregulation (Continued)

### The Limitations of Human Thermoregulation

- **Inability to produce cold:** Unlike heat production and conservation, humans cannot actively cool themselves down.
- **Reliance on technology:** Air conditioning is essential for survival in extremely hot environments.
- **Misconception of personal responsibility:** The belief that individuals can overcome heat through willpower or self-discipline is incorrect.
- **Government responsibility:** Providing cooling centers during heatwaves is crucial for public health.

### Case Study: Texas Prison Heat Deaths

- Ten inmates died from hyperthermia due to extreme heat in a prison without air conditioning.
- Misattribution of blame: The warden blamed inmates for poor decision-making rather than acknowledging the environmental factors.
- Importance of understanding the biology of thermoregulation: This case highlights the need for accurate information about human physiology in policy-making.
