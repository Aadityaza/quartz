## Lecture Notes: The Vestibular System and Gaze Control

**I. Introduction**

- The vestibular system is a sensory system that contributes to our sense of balance and gaze control.
- Unlike senses like sight and hearing, the vestibular system is not as readily apparent and was only discovered in the late 19th century.
- This is because the vestibular system works unconsciously in the background to keep our balance and stabilize our gaze.

**II. Functions of the Vestibular System**

- Maintains balance: The vestibular system allows us to maintain balance during static activities like standing still and dynamic activities like tightrope walking.
- Stabilizes gaze: The vestibular system ensures our gaze (where we're looking) remains steady even when our head moves. This is crucial for maintaining a clear visual world.

**III. Example: Cyclist Maintaining Gaze**

The lecture uses a cyclist as an example. Even though the cyclist's body and bike are tilted while banking around a curve, the vestibular system keeps the head upright (perpendicular to the ground) to maintain a level horizon in the visual field. This is an unconscious reflex that keeps our vision stable.

**IV. Consequences of Vestibular Dysfunction**

- When the vestibular system malfunctions, we become acutely aware of its importance.
- Symptoms can include:
    - Disbalance or feeling like the room is spinning
    - Nausea and vomiting
    - These symptoms can be very disturbing.

**V. Upcoming Topic: Stimulus for the Vestibular System**

The next part of the lecture will discuss the stimulus that activates the vestibular system.
