**Cerebellum and Information Processing**

- The cerebellum receives a massive amount of sensory information (40 times more than it sends out).
- There are two main types of input:
    - **Efference copy:** A copy of the motor command sent from the cerebral cortex to the muscles. This tells the cerebellum what movement was intended.
        - The cerebellum receives efference copy from both the cerebral cortex and the motor neurons themselves.
    - **Sensory reafference:** Sensory information received from the body after a movement is made. This tells the cerebellum what movement actually happened.

**Cerebellar Learning**

- The cerebellum compares efference copy with sensory reafference.
- If the intended movement (efference copy) and the actual movement (sensory reafference) don't match, the cerebellum makes adjustments.
- This is a form of associative learning, where the cerebellum learns to associate specific sensory feedback with specific parts of a movement.

**Example: Serving a Tennis Ball**

- As you serve a tennis ball, the cerebellum anticipates the sensory feedback you should feel at each stage of the movement.
- If you botch a serve, it's because the sensory feedback you receive deviates from what the cerebellum expected.
- This feedback helps the cerebellum refine your movements for future attempts.

**Overall**

- The cerebellum plays a crucial role in motor control by using sensory information to ensure smooth and coordinated movements.
- The lecture will explore specific examples of cerebellar learning in the next segments.
