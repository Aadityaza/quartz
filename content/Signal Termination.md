This lecture explores the mechanisms that ensure neurotransmitter signals have an "off switch":

**Three Termination Mechanisms:**

1. **Diffusion:**
    
    - Neurotransmitter molecules naturally spread out from the release site.
    - Only molecules within reach of the postsynaptic cell's receptors can be detected.
2. **Reuptake:**
    
    - Presynaptic neurons have transporters that "recycle" released neurotransmitters.
    - This is crucial for maintaining neurotransmitter economy and preventing excessive stimulation.
    - Drugs like cocaine target reuptake transporters, influencing neurotransmitter levels and potentially leading to addiction.
3. **Enzymatic Degradation:**
    
    - Specific enzymes in the synaptic cleft break down certain neurotransmitters.
    - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an example that rapidly degrades acetylcholine.
    - Blocking AChE with drugs like physostigmine can be used to treat conditions like myasthenia gravis where acetylcholine signaling is weak.
    - Conversely, organophosphate pesticides act as AChE inhibitors, leading to excessive muscle contraction and potentially fatal respiratory failure.

**Key Points:**

- Termination mechanisms ensure controlled and transient neurotransmitter signaling.
- Reuptake and degradation play a vital role in regulating neurotransmitter levels and their effects.
- Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing drugs that target specific neurotransmitter systems.
