**Light's Journey and Phototransduction**

- Light enters the eye and focuses on the **retina**, located at the back of the eye.
- Light first passes through a layer of **retinal ganglion cells** (their function will be explained later).
- It then travels through several more cell layers before reaching the **photoreceptors**.
- **Photoreceptors** are specialized cells that convert light energy into electrical signals. They consist of a cell body and an outer segment.
- Light must hit the **outer segment** of the photoreceptor for phototransduction to occur.

**Phototransduction: Converting Light to Electricity**

- **Rhodopsin**, a molecule within the outer segment, absorbs photons (light particles).
- Upon absorbing a photon, rhodopsin changes its shape, triggering a change in the electrical potential of the cell membrane. This is **phototransduction**.
- Vitamin A is a crucial component of rhodopsin, explaining why vitamin A deficiency can impair vision.

**The Importance of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)**

- It might seem illogical for light to travel through several cell layers before reaching the photoreceptors.
- However, the photoreceptor outer segments, where rhodopsin resides, require a partnership with the **retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)** located at the back of the retina.
- The RPE, a layer of non-neural cells, plays a vital role:
    - It renews rhodopsin, a process essential for photoreceptor function.
    - It nourishes and supports the photoreceptors.
- Disruption of the connection between photoreceptors and RPE, such as retinal detachment, can significantly impair vision.

**Key Takeaways**

- Photoreceptors and the RPE work together in a crucial partnership for vision.
- Any disruption of this partnership can be detrimental to vision and requires treatment.
- A healthy RPE and well-functioning photoreceptors are essential for good vision.
