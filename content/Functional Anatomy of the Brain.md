## Brain Structure and Function

**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):**
![[Pasted image 20240509204441.png|400]]
- Black part indicated by  arrow
- Protects the brain from trauma by acting as a cushion.
- Provides nutrients to the brain.
- Helps remove waste products.

**Grey Matter:**
![[Pasted image 20240509220632.png|300]]
- Contains neuronal cell bodies responsible for information processing.
- Determines whether or not a signal is sent to the next cell.

**White Matter:**
![[Pasted image 20240509220703.png|300]]
- Consists of axon fibers that transmit information between brain regions.
- Major bundles include:
    
    - Anterior cingulate cortex (left-right hemisphere communication)
    - Posterior cingulate cortex (left-right hemisphere communication)
    - Corpus callosum (major left-right hemisphere communication bundle)

**Primary Motor Cortex:**

- Located in the dorsal frontal lobe.
- Plans and executes movements.
- Cortical neurons send long axon down the spinal cord to initiate muscle movements.
- Orderly somatotopic organization:
- ![[Pasted image 20240509221656.png|400]]
    - Foot and leg area - medial and most middle
    - Hand, face, tongue - more lateral
    

**Primary Somatosensory Cortex:**

- Receives sensory input from the entire body.
- Orderly somatotopic organization based on receptor density:
    ![[Pasted image 20240509221741.png|400]]
    - Face, lips, eyes - larger cortical representation
    - Shoulder, torso - smaller cortical representation
    

**Thalamus:**
	![[Pasted image 20240509221843.png|400]]
- Relays sensory and motor information throughout the brain.
- Regulates sleep and consciousness.
- Left thalamus receives sensory information from the right side of the body.
- Left motor cortex controls movement on the right side of the body (contralateral control).

**Visual Cortex:**
	![[Pasted image 20240509221938.png|400]]
- Processes visual features like orientation, motion, and color.
- Organized by visual field:
    
    - Right visual field processed by left hemisphere
    - Left visual field processed by right hemisphere
    
- Further subdivided for complex processing:
    ![[Pasted image 20240509224259.png]]
    - V1: primary visual cortex (initial processing)
    - Dorsal stream (V2, MT, MST, Parietal regions): processes where and how an object is moving
    - Ventral stream (V2, V4, medial temporal lobe): processes what an object is
    

**Cerebellum:**

- Coordinates posture, balance, and movement smoothness.
- May also play a role in cognition (unclear).

**Conclusion:**

- The brain is composed of specialized regions with distinct functions.
- These regions work together to allow us to perceive and interact with the world.
