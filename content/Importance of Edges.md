This lecture builds on the previous one by explaining how the visual cortex interprets the information about light and dark received from the retina.

**Key Points:**

- **Center-Surround Organization:** The neurons in the retina and thalamus respond more strongly to a difference in light intensity between the center and the surrounding area.
- **Edge Detection:** The elongated receptive fields in the primary visual cortex are most sensitive to edges with a specific orientation.
- **Cornsweet Illusion:** This illusion demonstrates how our brains perceive edges based on relative brightness, not absolute luminance.![[Pasted image 20240328114611.png|300]]
- **Importance of Edges:** We need edges in both space (like boundaries between objects) and time (like changes in the visual scene) for proper perception.
    - Our brains use tiny eye movements (saccades) to constantly create new edges in time as we fixate on objects.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions that higher processing of visual information will be discussed in a future segment.

I hope this summary is helpful!
