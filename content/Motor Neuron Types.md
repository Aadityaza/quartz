## Motor Neurons and Muscle Fibers

This lecture segment explains the connection between motor neurons and the different types of skeletal muscle fibers.

**Key Points:**

- Different motor neurons innervate different types of muscle fibers.
- There are three main types of motor neurons:
    - **Slow motor neurons:** Innervate slow muscle fibers for sustained contractions.
    - **Fast fatigue-resistant motor neurons:** Innervate fast muscle fibers that can use both oxygen and glycogen for contractions lasting around 30 minutes.
    - **Fast fatigable motor neurons:** Innervate fast muscle fibers reliant solely on glycogen, leading to fatigue in 3-5 minutes.

**Motor Units:**

- A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates.
- The number of muscle fibers per motor unit varies:
    - Slow motor neurons innervate few muscle fibers.
    - Fast fatigue-resistant motor neurons innervate more muscle fibers.
    - Fast fatigable motor neurons innervate the most muscle fibers.

**Impact on Movement and Disease:**

- Recruitment of different motor neuron types allows for smooth movements.
- In diseases like polio, motor neuron death leads to muscle weakness because the denervated muscle fibers cannot function.
- Post-polio syndrome might arise due to overworked remaining motor neurons struggling to compensate for lost ones.
