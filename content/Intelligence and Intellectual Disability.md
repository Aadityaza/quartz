### Emergence of Intelligence

- Intelligence is an emergent property of the cerebral cortex.
- Traditional concept of a single "g" factor for general intelligence is being challenged.
- Current understanding leans towards multiple intelligences arising from both cerebral and cerebellar cortex.
- Cerebellum crucial for fine-tuned motor skills like dance, music, and athletics.

### Intelligence and Development

- Ability to develop intelligence occurs throughout life.
- Intellectual disability affects approximately 5% of the population, a significantly higher rate than other neurological disorders.

### Causes of Intellectual Disability

- **Inherited:** Fragile X Syndrome, Down Syndrome
- **Environmental:** Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
- **Genetic:** Phenylketonuria (PKU) - inability to process an amino acid

### Misconceptions About Brain Structure and Intelligence

- Belief that smaller or smoother brains lead to intellectual disability is incorrect.
- Some intellectual disabilities are associated with larger-than-average brains (e.g., autism, Fragile X Syndrome).

### Complexities of Intellectual Disability

- Intellectual disability not solely due to brain size, neuron count, or other single factor.
- Issues can arise from misdirected dendrites, misaligned synapses, or incorrect connections.
- Intriguing aspect: individuals with intellectual disabilities can excel in specific areas (e.g., savant syndrome).
- Savant syndrome demonstrates that intelligence is multifaceted and not uniformly impaired.
