## Using Beta Blockers to Treat PTSD

This lecture discusses the potential treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using beta blockers. Here are the key points:

- **Emotional memories are stronger:** Memories associated with strong emotions are more likely to be remembered and reconsolidated (remade) each time they are recalled.
- **Beta blockers and memory reconsolidation:** By administering beta blockers during exposure therapy, the physical symptoms of the trauma (increased heart rate, blood pressure) are prevented. This may help to weaken the emotional response associated with the memory during reconsolidation.
- **Repeated exposure with beta blockers:** By repeatedly triggering the memory in a safe environment with reduced physical arousal, the overall emotional response to the trauma may be lessened.
- **Body and emotion connection:** The lecture suggests that the body's physical response to an experience can influence our emotions. By preventing the physical response, the emotional response may also be dampened.

**Additional points:**

- The example of the laughing man falling out of a kayak suggests that our physical state can influence our emotional experience.
- The speaker acknowledges that the effectiveness of this treatment approach is still being explored.
