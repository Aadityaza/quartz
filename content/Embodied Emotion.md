**Module Overview:**

- This module explores the link between emotions and the body's sensations.
- It focuses on the automatic body responses associated with emotions.

**Key Points:**

- **Emotions and Body:**
    - Body states influence emotions (e.g., feeling scared due to bungee jumping).
    - Some body states are voluntary (e.g., facial expressions), while others are automatic (e.g., heart rate increase).
    - The lecture focuses on **automatic body states**.
- **The "Chicken or the Egg" Debate:**
    - A historical debate exists about whether emotions cause physical reactions or vice versa.
    - The lecture argues that **emotions and body states likely work together** (except in cases like panic attacks).
    - Both the brain and body contribute to a unified "body-brain-emotion" state.
- **Module Focus:**
    - The module will primarily explore the **sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems** and their role in automatic body responses related to emotions.
