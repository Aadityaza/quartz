## Lecture Notes: Autonomic Nervous System Across the Lifespan

![[Pasted image 20240305190334.png]]

**I. Beyond "Fight or Flight" and "Rest and Digest"**

- The lecture clarifies that **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** activity isn't always at extremes.
- We typically exist in a **dynamic balance** between the two, with shifts based on immediate needs (e.g., encountering a threat vs. relaxing after a meal).

**II. Sympathetic Dominance Across the Lifespan**

- An additional layer of complexity is the **gradual shift towards sympathetic dominance** throughout life.
- **Young children:** More **parasympathetically dominant**, focusing on growth and nutrient absorption.
- **Older adults:** More **sympathetically dominant**, potentially contributing to conditions like hypertension.

**III. Factors Influencing Autonomic Tone**

- **Physical activity:** Highly trained **aerobic athletes** exhibit stronger **parasympathetic dominance** (e.g., lower resting heart rate).
- **Age:** As we age, the **natural shift towards sympathetic dominance** may contribute to age-related health concerns like hypertension.

**IV. Connection to Future Lecture**

- The lecture concludes by foreshadowing a future segment discussing **drugs targeting the autonomic nervous system** to manage conditions like hypertension.

**V. Key Takeaways**

- The autonomic nervous system's activity isn't solely "fight or flight" or "rest and digest."
- A **balance** exists between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, shifting based on immediate needs and life stage.
- **Sympathetic dominance** increases with age, potentially impacting health.
