- **Growth of Neuroimaging:**
    - The number of studies using neuroimaging has grown exponentially since the early 1990s.
    - The amount of data collected per study has also grown exponentially.
    - Modern neuroimaging data analysis is a big data problem.
- **Goal of the Note:**
    - Provide an overview of neuroscience relevant to understanding, analyzing, collecting, and interpreting neuroimaging data.
- **What is Neuroscience?**
    - The multidisciplinary study of the biological basis of behavior.
    - Includes disciplines like neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neurophysiology, and neuropsychology.
    - Has many branches including molecular, cognitive, clinical, computational, developmental, and cultural neuroscience.
- **What is Neuroimaging?**
    - A collection of methods to image the structural, functional, and chemical properties of the central nervous system.
    - Used by many disciplines and branches of neuroscience.
- **Note Topics:**
    - Structural and functional organization of the brain.
