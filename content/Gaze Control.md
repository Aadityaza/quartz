## Eye Movements: Beyond the Vestibulo-ocular Reflex (VOR)


This lecture explores eye movements beyond the VOR (Vestibulo-ocular reflex), which stabilizes gaze during head movements.

- **Cancelling the VOR:** We can override the VOR to maintain fixation on a target while moving our head. This gaze control is crucial for clear vision.
- **The Ocular Motor Field:** This field of study investigates how the nervous system controls eye movements for precise visual acuity.
- **Eye Movements and Perception:** Eye movements not only serve a physiological purpose but also reveal information about a person's state and attention.
    - Gaze control: Focused gaze in someone like Toula (example in video) suggests intentness.
    - Social interaction: Shifty eyes or maintaining eye contact communicate different social cues.
    - Neuropsychiatric conditions: Eye movements can be affected in various conditions like depression (difficulty making eye contact) and autism (altered scanning patterns).

**Global vs. Local Processing:**

The example of the illusory H (made of Es) demonstrates how eye movements influence perception:

- Looking at the entire image (global processing) leads to perceiving an H.
- Focusing on individual components (local processing) reveals the Es.

**Next Lecture:**

The next lecture will delve deeper into saccades, the primary eye movement for shifting gaze.
