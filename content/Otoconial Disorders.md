**I. Otoconial Mass Composition and Degeneration**

- Otoconial masses are made of otoconins, proteins produced before birth.
- The supporting structure includes a gooey substance that deteriorates with age.

**II. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**

- A chunk of the otoconial mass can break off and lodge in the lower part of the vestibular system.
- This triggers vertigo (sensation of spinning) when the head moves in a certain position.
- BPPV is a common condition but can be treated with maneuvers to dislodge the otoconia.

**III. Presbyequilibrium**

- The gooey substance weakens with age, causing the otoconial mass to lose density.
- A less dense otoconial mass is a poor gravity sensor.
- This age-related decline in equilibrium function is similar to presbycusis (hearing loss) and presbyopia (loss of near vision).
- Presbyequilibrium can lead to balance problems in older adults.

**IV. Next Steps**

- The lecture will discuss slow head movements.
