**III. Classification of Voluntary Movements (Continued):**

- **Reflexes:**
    - Defined by:
        - Involuntary responses to stimuli.
        - Not requiring conscious thought or intention.
        - Examples:
            - Knee jerk reflex
            - Withdrawal reflex from hot objects
            - Stumble reflex
    - Occur at lower levels of the motor hierarchy without needing the brain.
    - Involve motor neurons stimulating skeletal muscles for contraction.

**Stereotyped Automatic Movements:**

- Defined by:
    - Repetitive, learned movements performed frequently.
    - Examples:
        - Chewing
        - Walking
        - Running
        - Standing
        - Vomiting (though less frequent)
    - Produced by central pattern generators (CPGs) in the spinal cord and brainstem.
    - CPGs are neural circuits that generate rhythmic patterns without extensive cortical input.

**Movements of Self-Expression:**

- Defined by:
    - Intentional and purposeful movements.
    - Driven by the cortical motor control centers.
    - Examples:
        - Reaching
        - Talking
        - Fine motor skills (picking food out of teeth, writing)
        - Dancing

**Motor Hierarchy:**

- The lecture introduces the concept of the motor hierarchy, a layered system controlling movement complexity.
    - Lower levels (motor neurons and spinal cord) generate basic movements.
    - Higher levels (brainstem and cortex) add complexity, intention, and meaning.
- A simple twitch is produced by motor neuron excitation.
- Central pattern generators create basic rhythmic movements.
- Brainstem motor control centers enable more complex movements like walking and posture.
- Cortical motor control centers are responsible for intentional movements with meaning and purpose.
- Neocortex involvement imbues movement with intention and transforms it into action.

**Key Points:**

- Reflexes, stereotyped movements, and movements of self-expression are distinct categories based on control level and intentionality.
- The motor hierarchy plays a crucial role in coordinating movement complexity.
- Cortical involvement adds meaning and purpose to movement, transforming it into action.

**Note:**

- This section expands on the three movement categories and introduces the motor hierarchy concept.
