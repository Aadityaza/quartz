### The Basal Ganglia as a Selector

- **Parkinson's is not a motor hierarchy problem:** The issue lies in selecting actions, not executing them.
- **Striatum as a central hub:** Receives input from the entire cerebral cortex, processing information related to movement, sensation, language, and more.
- **Basal ganglia's role:** Acts as a selector for actions, thoughts, perceptions, moods, and emotions.
- **Disorders beyond movement:** Issues with the basal ganglia can contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions like:
    - Tics: Unwanted, repetitive movements or vocalizations.
    - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Repetitive thoughts and actions.
    - Schizophrenia: Disordered thinking, perception, and emotion.

### The Vase Analogy

- **Perceptual selection:** Similar to choosing to see a vase or two faces in a drawing, the basal ganglia helps select which perception to focus on.
- **Impaired selection:** Difficulty in choosing between multiple perceptions can lead to confusion and disorientation, as seen in conditions like schizophrenia.

### Conclusion

The basal ganglia plays a critical role in selecting and initiating actions, thoughts, and perceptions. Dysfunction in this brain region can contribute to a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Understanding the basal ganglia is essential for developing effective treatments for Parkinson's disease and other related conditions.
