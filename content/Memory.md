- **Case of Edouard Claparede:** A neurologist who treated an amnesic patient.
    - Repeatedly introduced himself without recognition.
    - However, the patient learned to associate the doctor with pain (pinprick) and refused to shake his hand.

### Types of Memory

1. **Working Memory:**
    - Short-term memory lasting about 30 seconds.
    - Example: Remembering a phone number temporarily.
2. **Explicit Memory:**
    - Consciously recalled memories.
    - Includes episodic memories (personal experiences) and semantic memories (facts and knowledge).
    - Example: Remembering what you ate for breakfast, learning the meaning of "hegira".
3. **Implicit Memory:**
    - Unconsciously recalled memories.
    - Types:
        - **Motor memories:** Learning to ride a bike.
        - **Procedural memories:** Improving at mirror tracing.
        - **Emotional memories:** Basis for phobias and PTSD.
        - **Perceptual memories:** Recognizing patterns or objects (e.g., finding a hidden owl in a picture).

### Key Points

- Amnesic patients can form implicit memories but not explicit ones.
- The brain regions involved in different types of memory are distinct.
- Implicit memories are long-lasting and not easily forgotten.

### Example: Implicit Memory as Attendance Taker

- Using a picture with a hidden object (e.g., dalmatian) to determine class attendance.
- Students who attended class could identify the hidden object, demonstrating implicit memory.
