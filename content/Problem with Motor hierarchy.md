## Voluntary Movement Lecture Notes 

** Impact of Damage to the Motor System**

- The lecture explores how damage at different levels of the motor hierarchy affects movement.

**Motor Neuron Damage:**

- Caused by diseases like polio, Guillian-Barre syndrome, and neuromuscular junction problems.
- Disrupts the connection between motor neurons and muscles.
- Results in:
    - **Complete paralysis:** No muscle movement is possible (flaccid paralysis).
    - **Loss of reflexes:** Reflexes cannot occur without motor neuron stimulation.
    - **Muscle atrophy:** Disuse leads to muscle weakness and shrinkage.

**Cortical Motor Cortex Damage (Stroke):**

- Damage to the primary motor cortex disrupts voluntary movement control.
- **Reflexes:** Can become exaggerated (hyperreflexia) due to disinhibition.
- **Stereotyped movements:** Can still occur (walking, chewing).
- **Movements of self-expression:** Impaired, especially for muscles controlled by the affected cortex area.
    - Example: Difficulty lifting the left leg due to damage in the left motor cortex.

**The Motor Hierarchy in Action:**

- The lecture emphasizes the concept of the motor hierarchy as a top-down control system.
- Cortical motor control centers can influence:
    - Brainstem motor control centers
    - Central pattern generators
    - Motor interneurons
    - Motor neurons (limited direct connection)
- Information flow is primarily top-down (cortex to lower levels).
- Lower levels cannot directly communicate back to the cortex (with some exceptions).

**Key Points:**

- Damage location within the motor hierarchy determines the type of movement impairment.
- Motor neuron damage leads to complete paralysis and loss of reflexes.
- Cortical damage can cause hyperreflexia, preserve stereotyped movements, and impair voluntary control.
- The motor hierarchy functions in a top-down manner with limited feedback from lower levels.

**Note:**

- This section discusses the consequences of damage at different levels of the motor system. The concept of the motor hierarchy as a top-down control system is reinforced.
