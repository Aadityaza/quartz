## Neurons and Electrical Signals

**Ions and Membranes:**

- Neurons use **ions** (charged molecules) instead of electrons for electrical signals.
- Ions can be **positively charged** (e.g., potassium K+) or **negatively charged** (e.g., chloride Cl-).
- The cell membrane is a **fatty layer** that acts as a barrier for ions.
- **Ion channels** are special openings in the membrane that allow specific ions to pass through.

**Ion Distribution and Resting Potential:**

- Ions have a **chemical force** (like a dye) that pushes them to distribute evenly across the membrane.
- The cell interior is **negatively charged**, while the exterior is close to neutral (grounded).
- This creates an **electrical force** attracting positively charged ions inside the cell.
- A balance between **chemical and electrical forces** determines the resting **membrane potential** (around -70 to -60 millivolts).

**Key Points:**

- Neurons use a special system with ions and channels for electrical signaling.
- The cell membrane plays a crucial role in controlling ion flow.
- Resting potential is a delicate balance between opposing forces.

Electrical Terms Analogy: Water and Neurons

This lecture uses a water analogy to explain electrical terms in the context of neurons:

- **Potential:** Similar to water level, it represents the "voltage" difference between two points. No difference, no flow (current).
- **Current:** The flow of water (charged ions in neurons) driven by the potential difference. Higher potential difference (waterfall) creates a stronger current.
- **Resistance:**  

**Key Points in Neurons:**

- **Potential difference:** Measured in millivolts (mV), it exists between the inside and outside of the cell (around -65 mV).
- **Ion channels:** These are openings in the membrane that allow charged ions (current carriers) to move in and out of the cell.
- **Resistance:** The cell membrane itself has resistance to the flow of ions, which can be influenced by the number of open ion channels.
