## Detailed Reference Note on Synaptic Receptors

**Receptors: Receiving the Message**

Following neurotransmitter release, the postsynaptic cell needs to receive the signal. This is achieved through **receptors**, which are **multi-protein complexes** embedded in the postsynaptic membrane.

**Receptor Structure and Function:**

- **Transmembrane proteins:** They span the entire cell membrane, creating a **pore** for ions to pass through.
- **Normally closed:** Ions cannot flow through the pore until activated.
- **Activation by neurotransmitters:** Binding of specific neurotransmitters triggers a conformational change, opening the pore.
- **Selective permeability:** Different receptors allow passage of specific ions (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride).

**Types of Receptors:**

- **Excitatory receptors:** Increase the membrane potential, bringing it closer to the threshold for an action potential (firing).
    - **Example:** Glutamate receptor (GluR)
- **Inhibitory receptors:** Decrease the membrane potential, moving it further away from the threshold, making it less likely to fire an action potential.
    - **Example:** Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor

**Impact on Diseases and Therapeutics:**

- **Myasthenia Gravis (MG):** An autoimmune disease where antibodies destroy **acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)** at the neuromuscular junction.
    - **Symptoms:** Muscle weakness due to impaired neuromuscular communication.
    - **Treatments:**
        - **Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors:** Prolong the action of acetylcholine by preventing its degradation, allowing it to reach the remaining AChRs.
        - **Immunosuppressants:** Reduce antibody production to prevent further AChR destruction.

**Key Points:**

- Receptors are crucial for converting the chemical signal (neurotransmitter) into an electrical signal (action potential) in the postsynaptic cell.
- Different receptor types mediate excitatory or inhibitory effects.
- Understanding receptor function is essential for developing treatments for various neurological disorders.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions "glutamyl" as the neurotransmitter for the excitatory glutamate receptor. This is a slight inaccuracy. Glutamate itself is the neurotransmitter, not "glutamyl."
