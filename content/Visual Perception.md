This lecture explains how the visual information processed in the primary visual cortex is used to create meaningful perceptions in higher brain areas.

**Key Points:**

- **Extrastriate Cortex:** This area of the brain receives information from the primary visual cortex and is responsible for visual perception.
- **Two Processing Streams:**
    - **Ventral Stream (What Pathway):** Processes object identification and recognition. Damage to this area can cause visual agnosia, where patients can see basic features but cannot understand what they are looking at. Examples include prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces).
    - **Dorsal Stream (Where Pathway):** Processes motion, location, and spatial relationships. This area is important for guiding actions and tool use. Damage to this area can impair depth perception and the ability to reach for objects.
- **Attention:** Paying attention to specific parts of the visual field is crucial for perception. Hemispatial neglect is a condition where patients with right-brain damage ignore everything on the left side of their visual field, even though their vision is physically intact.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions a case study of a person who could perceive motion (rain) despite having damage to the primary visual cortex.
- The next lecture will discuss how visual perception develops in infants
