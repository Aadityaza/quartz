**Introduction**

- The human brain is vastly different from the brains of simpler animals like sharks and alligators.
- This difference is due to the expansion of the telencephalon, specifically the cerebral cortex.

**The Telencephalon**

- The telencephalon is the part of the forebrain that is responsible for higher-order functions like learning, memory, and thought.
- In humans, the telencephalon is the largest part of the brain.
- The expansion of the telencephalon is what allows humans to have complex behavior.

**The Cerebral Cortex**

- The cerebral cortex is the **outer layer** of the telencephalon.
- It is made up of six layers of neurons and is only found in mammals.
- The cerebral cortex is responsible for most of the higher-order functions of the brain.
- The large surface area of the cerebral cortex is due to the presence of sulci (folds(valleys)) and gyri (convolutions(hills)).

**Microcephaly**

- Microcephaly is a condition in which the baby is born with a small head and brain.
- It can be caused by a variety of factors, including the Zika virus.
- The severity of microcephaly depends on when during gestation the infection occurs.

**Additional Notes**

- The lecture mentions that the neural tube forms by day 28 of human gestation.
- The lecture also mentions that the Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus.

**Conclusion**

- The expansion of the telencephalon, particularly the cerebral cortex, is what allows humans to have complex behavior and is the foundation of our intelligence.

Hine brain = Cerebellum + Medulla + Pons
Mid brain   = small
Diencephalon = small ( has optical nerves)
Telencephalon = right & left  ( biggest - envelops the rest of the brain)
