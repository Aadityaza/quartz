**I. Introduction**

**II. Defining Self-Generated Movements (Acknowledging Debate)**

- The lecturer acknowledges the philosophical aspect of defining "self-generated movements."
- Movements initiated by the spinal cord and brainstem (reflexes, stereotyped movements) are excluded due to their lower-level processing.
- **Self-generated movements (Lecturer's Definition):** Movements initiated by the forebrain, a higher brain region responsible for conscious thought and planning. This definition is open to debate.

**III. Types of Self-Generated Movements (To be covered later)**

1. **[[Volitional Movements]]:**
    
    - Deliberate and intentional movements (e.g., raising your hand to answer a question).
2. **[[Emotional Movements]]:**
    
    - Movements driven by emotions (e.g., flinching away from a loud noise).

**IV. Other Brainstem Movements**

- **Orienting Movements:**
    - Involuntary head or eye movements in response to stimuli (e.g., looking at a sound source).
    - Example: The dog (Tula) in the video orienting its head towards a sound.
