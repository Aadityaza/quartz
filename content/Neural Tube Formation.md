## Neural Tube Formation Lecture Notes

**Introduction**

This lecture discusses how the neural plate, a sheet of cells in the early embryo, transforms into the neural tube, the precursor to the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS stretches from the brain to the spinal cord.

**Neurulation Process**

1. **Folding:** The central portion of the neural plate folds upwards, creating a neural fold (or neural groove).
    
2. **Invagination:** The neural folds continue to fold inwards until they nearly touch in the midline, forming an omega shape.
    
3. **Tube Formation:** The neural folds fuse together to form a hollow tube, the neural tube.
    
4. **Neural Crest Cells:** The wings on either side of the neural plate, called neural crests, remain separate and will contribute to the peripheral nervous system and other structures.
    
5. **Closure:** The neural tube closure begins in the middle (neck region) and zips up towards the head (anterior neuropore) and down towards the tail (posterior neuropore).
    

**Timeline**

- Day 21: Neural fold formation begins.
- Day 28: Neural tube closure is complete.
- Entire process takes about a week.

**Additional Points**

- After the neural tube forms, other tissues like skin, muscle, and bone develop around it for protection.
- Failure of proper neural tube closure can lead to neural tube defects.

**Next Steps**

The lecture will explore potential problems that can arise during neural tube closure.
