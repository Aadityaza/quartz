**Building on Broca and Dax**

- Since Broca's discovery, we've learned more about brain organization for language, primarily in the left hemisphere.

**A Simplified Language Circuit**

- Spoken language enters auditory cortex in both hemispheres.
- On the left, it's processed further in:
    - Ventral temporal lobe
    - Temporoparietal junction (TPJ) - integrates sensory information

**Dorsal vs. Ventral Pathways**

- Information from TPJ travels to the frontal lobe through two pathways:
    - Dorsal pathway (superior): responsible for speech production.
    - Ventral pathway (inferior): responsible for speech comprehension.

**Understanding Speech**

1. Sounds are analyzed on different timescales (phonemes, syllables, etc.).
2. The ventral pathway organizes these sounds and creates an interpretation.
3. This interpretation is sent to the TPJ, which acts as a "lexical interface" attaching meaning (semantics) to the sounds.

**Visual and Somatosensory Input**

- People who are deaf use visual (sign language) or somatosensory (braille) input.
- This sensory information also goes to the TPJ for semantic interpretation.
- A case study of a woman who lost braille reading after a visual cortex stroke demonstrates this shared pathway.

**Language vs. Articulation Disorders**

- Damage to Broca's area (dorsal pathway) affects sign language production as well as speech, indicating a language disorder, not an articulation issue.

**Wernicke's Aphasia**

- Lesions near the temporal lobe cause Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by fluent speech but impaired comprehension.
- Difficulty understanding complex sentences is a hallmark.

**Why Link Sensory and Motor Areas?**

- We learn language by hearing it, so comprehension is crucial for developing speech production.
- We constantly learn new words, requiring the link between sensory input and motor output.
- People who lose hearing often experience speech degradation, highlighting the ongoing feedback loop between production and comprehension.

**Conclusion**

- This simplified circuit offers a basic understanding of language processing.
- Aphasia is a devastating condition, but recovery is possible after a stroke.
