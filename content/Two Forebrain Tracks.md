##  The Brain's Structure and Connectivity

This lecture focused on the development of the brain's connectivity between its major parts.

**Key Points:**

- The **telencephalon**, initially two separate hemispheres, expands and covers the other brain regions.
- In an adult brain, two important structures bridge these regions:
    - **Corpus callosum:** Connects the two hemispheres, enabling communication between them.
    - **Internal capsules:** Connect the telencephalon to the diencephalon. They carry crucial information, including motor information to the muscles.

**Brain Connectivity:**

- Initially, the hemispheres are separate structures.
- The **corpus callosum** develops later, allowing communication between the hemispheres.

- The **internal capsules** connect the telencephalon (cerebral cortex) to the diencephalon. They carry information, including motor signals that control muscles on the opposite side of the body.

**Brain Regions:**

- **Spinal cord:** Carries signals between the brain and the body.
- **Hindbrain:** Includes the pons, medulla, and cerebellum. Involved in basic functions like breathing and heart rate.
- **Midbrain:** Relays sensory and motor information.
- **Diencephalon:** Contains structures like the thalamus, which relays sensory information to the cortex.
- **Telencephalon:** Makes up the cerebrum, the largest part of the brain. The outer layer is the cerebral cortex, responsible for higher functions like thinking and memory.

**Additional Notes:**

- The space in the center of the brain (ventricles) contains cerebrospinal fluid and is not brain tissue.
- A midsagittal cut divides the brain in half along the midline.
- A parasagittal cut is similar to a midsagittal cut but slightly off-center.
- A horizontal cut divides the brain parallel to the ground.

**Final Diagram:**

The lecture concludes by introducing a simplified brain diagram that will be used throughout the course. This diagram shows the major brain regions and their connections via the corpus callosum and internal capsules.
