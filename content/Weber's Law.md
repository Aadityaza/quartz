Weber's Law, formulated by German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber in the 19th century, describes the relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the perception of change in that stimulus. Essentially, the law states that the just noticeable difference (JND) between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli. In simpler terms, the more intense the stimulus, the larger the change needed for a person to notice the difference. This law has applications in various fields, including psychology, marketing, and economics, helping to understand how humans perceive differences in stimuli such as weight, brightness, or sound.
