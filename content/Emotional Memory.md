### The Power of Emotional Memory

- **Emotional events are more memorable:** Our brains prioritize encoding emotionally charged experiences.
    - Example: Remembering a car accident vividly compared to a parked car.
- **Adaptive function:** This helps us learn from significant life events.
    - Examples: Falling in love, birth of a child, loss of a loved one.

### Trauma and Memory

- **Trauma and sensory details:** Traumatic events are often linked to specific sensory cues (sights, sounds, smells).
- **PTSD:** Re-exposure to these cues can trigger intense emotional responses.
    - This process involves the body's sympathetic nervous system.

### Treatment: Beta-Blockers

- **Reducing emotional response:** Beta-blockers can dampen the physical symptoms of anxiety and arousal.
- **Memory reconsolidation:** By experiencing the trauma-related cues without the intense emotional response, individuals can potentially form new, less distressing memories.
- **Potential for treatment:** This approach offers hope for individuals suffering from PTSD.
