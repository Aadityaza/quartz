I. Limited Intracranial Space

- Bleeds within the cranium have serious consequences due to restricted space

Anatomical Layers 
1. Skull 
2. Dura (tough outermost membrane) 
3. Arachnoid 
5. Pia 
6. Brain Parenchyma (brain tissue)

Potential Bleed Locations 
- Epidural Bleed (between skull and dura) 
	- Epidural/Extradural hematomas 
	- Extremely dangerous, often fatal if untreated 
	- E.g. Caused Natasha Richardson's death 
	- Lucid interval before deterioration

-  Subdural Bleed (between dura and arachnoid) 
   - Subdural hematomas
   - Can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening
   - More common in elderly
   
- Subarachnoid Bleed (in cerebrospinal fluid space)
   - Excruciating headache 
   - Very dangerous, can be fatal
   - E.g. Philip Hughes - vertebral artery rupture

- Intraparenchymal/Intracerebral Bleed
   - Hemorrhagic stroke within brain tissue
