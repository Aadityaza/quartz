**Introduction**

- The basal ganglia is a deep structure in the brain found in all vertebrates.
- Even simple organisms like hagfish have basal ganglia, demonstrating its core function: selecting actions.

**Why We Have More Complex Basal Ganglia**

Humans have a more complex basal ganglia compared to hagfish due to several reasons:

- **Limbs and Digits:** We can move our limbs and digits in intricate ways, requiring precise selection of motor actions.
- **Gravity:** Unlike hagfish in water, we face constant gravitational pull. The basal ganglia need to choose movements that counteract gravity to maintain balance and posture.
- **Facial Movements:** We have complex facial expressions and eye movements that require careful coordination by the basal ganglia.
- **Multiple Movements:** We can perform various actions with the same body part (e.g., walking, jumping). The basal ganglia select the appropriate movement.
- **Social Complexity:** Social interactions require nuanced responses depending on the situation and past experiences. The basal ganglia factor in these complexities for movement selection.

**Key Takeaway**

The basal ganglia act as a central selector for our movements, considering various factors to choose the most appropriate action in a given situation.
