The meninges are three layers of membranes that form a barrier between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

The layers include the **pia mater** (closest to the CNS), the **arachnoid mater**, and the **dura mater** (farthest from the CNS), which is tough and protective.
