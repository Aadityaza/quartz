### The Role of the Hippocampus in Memory
![[Pasted image 20240814114530.png]]
- **Location:** The hippocampus is situated in the front part of the temporal lobe on both sides of the brain.
- **Structure:** It's a three-layered cerebral cortex, distinct from the six-layered neocortex.
- **Function:** The hippocampus is crucial for the formation of both semantic (factual knowledge) and episodic (personal experiences) memories.
    - Without a hippocampus, new memories of both types cannot be formed.
    - The case of HM illustrates this point: he could not form new episodic memories (e.g., not knowing who the president is) or semantic memories (e.g., not knowing the meaning of new words).

### Memory Consolidation and Retrieval

- **Memory Storage:** Once memories are formed, they are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex for storage.
- **Semantic Memory Retrieval:** Semantic memories are stored directly in the neocortex and can be accessed without involving the hippocampus.
    - Damage to the neocortex can result in the loss of specific semantic memories (as seen in the case of Jill Bolte Taylor, who lost her math skills).
- **Episodic Memory Retrieval:** Episodic memories are also stored in the neocortex but require the hippocampus for retrieval (reconsolidation).
    - This process of reconsolidation allows for potential changes in the memory each time it is retrieved.
