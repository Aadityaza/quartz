## Neurons and Neurotransmitters

This lecture dives into neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers used by neurons to communicate:

**Neurotransmitters:**

- Chemical messengers used by neurons to communicate across synapses.
- Packaged in tiny membrane-bound spheres called **synaptic vesicles**.
- Examples include glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine.

**Importance of Packaging:**

- Ensures neurotransmitters are concentrated and readily available for release.
- Plays a role in targeting specific types of neurons.

**Therapeutic Applications:**

- Understanding neurotransmitter synthesis is crucial for developing treatments.
- In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells die, leading to a deficiency.
- Levodopa (Sinemet, Parcopa) is a **precursor** (substrate) for dopamine synthesis used to alleviate symptoms.
- By flooding the system with levodopa, even a small amount of dopamine production can improve the patient's condition.

**Key Points:**

- Neurotransmitters are essential for communication between neurons.
- Packaging in vesicles is crucial for efficient and targeted signaling.
- Understanding neurotransmitter systems paves the way for developing treatments for neurological disorders.

## Neurons: Neurotransmitter Release

This lecture explains how an action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse:

**Problem:**

- Neurons need to prevent random release of neurotransmitters from vesicles.
- They also need to link neurotransmitter release to the arrival of action potentials.

**Solution:**

1. **Suppression of constitutive release:** A molecule within the terminal actively prevents spontaneous fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane.
2. **Linking release to action potential:**
    - Action potential arrival causes a rise in membrane potential.
    - This opens **calcium channels**, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal.
    - Increased calcium concentration triggers the fusion of vesicle membranes with the cell membrane.
    - Neurotransmitters are released through the fused membrane.

**Key Points:**

- Only action potentials trigger neurotransmitter release, ensuring a controlled communication system.
- Calcium ions act as a signal for vesicle fusion, linking electrical activity to chemical signaling.
