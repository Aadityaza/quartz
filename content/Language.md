- **Language as a Core Brain Function:** Language, both production and comprehension, is exclusively a function of the neocortex. No other brain region or animal species possess the same linguistic capabilities as humans.
- **Focus on Human Brain:** Most of our understanding of language stems from studying the human brain due to the limitations in understanding animal communication systems.

### The Dominant Hemisphere and Language

- **Left Hemisphere Dominance:** In the vast majority of humans (90-95%), the left hemisphere is dominant for language production.
- **Key Brain Areas:** The lecture focuses on four primary cortical areas:
    - **Primary Auditory Cortex:** Located in the dorsal part of the temporal lobe, responsible for hearing.
    - **Visual Cortex:** Found at the back of the brain, responsible for sight.
    - **Motor Cortex:** Located in the frontal lobe, controls voluntary movements, including those involved in speech.
    - **Somatosensory Cortex:** Situated in the parietal lobe, processes sensory information from the body.

### Language Processing Pathway

- **Auditory Input:** To comprehend language, auditory information is processed in the primary auditory cortex.
- **Wernicke's Area:** This area is crucial for language comprehension. It receives auditory information and processes it into meaningful language.
- **Broca's Area:** Located near the motor cortex, Broca's area is responsible for language production. Information from Wernicke's area is transmitted here for articulation.
- **Communication Pathway:** The connection between Wernicke's and Broca's areas is essential for fluent and coherent speech.

### Conclusion

The lecture provides a foundational overview of the brain regions involved in language processing. The next step will be to explore the types of language impairments that arise from damage to these areas.
