This lecture discusses the importance of early experiences for developing normal vision.

**Key Points:**

- **Mike May's Story:** This case study describes a man who regained sight after being blind for most of his life. Despite having perfect vision physically, he could not interpret complex visual information because his brain did not learn to do so during the critical period in childhood.
- **Sensitive Periods:** These are windows of time in early development when the brain is particularly receptive to certain types of learning. Visual perception skills like object recognition and depth perception need to be learned during this period.
- **Consequences of Missing the Critical Period:** If a child's vision is impaired during the sensitive period for visual development (e.g., due to cataracts), even corrective surgery later in life may not restore normal vision.
- **Importance of Early Intervention:** Early detection and treatment of vision problems in childhood are crucial for normal visual development.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions albinism as another condition that can disrupt the sensitive period for vision development.
- The next lecture will discuss hearing.
