This note covers the basic building blocks and organization of the human brain.


**I. Cellular Composition**
- The brain consists of two main cell types:
    - **Neurons:** Specialized cells for processing and transmitting information.
        - They have various shapes and sizes depending on function.
        - Key parts:
            - Cell body: Contains nucleus and organelles for energy and protein synthesis.
            - Dendrites: Receive signals from other neurons.
            - Axon: Transmits signals to other neurons.
            - Axon terminals: Communicate with other neurons.

	- **Glia:** Supportive cells for neurons.
	    - Outnumber neurons and perform various functions:
	        - Provide structure and scaffolding.
	        - Maintain neuronal environment.
	        - Insulate axons (myelin) for faster signal transmission.
	        - Three type of Glia
		        - Astrocytes
		        - Microglia
		        - Oligodendrocytes

**II. Brain Organization**

- Large group of similar and spatially organized neurons form the basis of dissociable brain structure and networks
![[Pasted image 20240430160456.png|400]]
There are three main ways to organize the brain:

- **Cytoarchitectural Organization (Brodmann Areas):**
    - Based on cell structure and composition.
    - Defined by Korbinian Brodmann in 1909.
    - Still used to locate brain regions in neuroimaging.
    - Applicable to various mammals (human, hedgehog, rabbit, etc.)
    - Brain atlases provide detailed Brodmann area information. (Print & electronic)

- **Functional Networks:**
    
    - Groups of brain structures connected for specific functions.
    - Examples:
        - Striatum (includes nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, putamen) - involved in reward and movement.
        - Medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex) - crucial for memory formation.
    
- **Lobes:**
    - Rudimentary anatomical classification based on location.
    - Six lobes with generally associated functions:
        - Frontal lobe: involved in planning, decision-making, movement.
        - Parietal lobe: involved in processing touch, spatial awareness.
        - Occipital lobe: involved in processing vision.
        - Temporal lobe: involved in processing hearing, memory, emotion.
        - Limbic lobe: involved in processing emotions and memory.
        - Insular cortex: involved in various functions like taste, self-awareness.

Understanding the brain's cellular composition and organization is crucial for studying its function and dysfunction.

## Vascular Anatomy of the Human Brain

![[Pasted image 20240430200217.png]]
**The Brain Needs a Lot of Energy:**

- The brain requires a tremendous amount of energy and oxygen to function properly.
- This is delivered through a complex system of arteries and veins.

**Blood Supply System:**
![[Pasted image 20240430200321.png|300]]
- The internal carotid artery is the main supplier of blood to the brain.
    - It originates from the aorta and splits from the common carotid artery.
    - The external carotid artery supplies blood to the face and skull.
- The internal carotid arteries lead to the Circle of Willis.

**Circle of Willis:**

- This is a ring-like structure formed by arteries at the base of the brain.
- It acts as a distribution hub for blood flow to different brain regions.
![[Pasted image 20240430200832.png]]
**Blood Distribution from the Circle of Willis:**

- Several arteries and veins branch out from the Circle of Willis, each supplying specific brain areas.
    - Listed arteries include:
        - Anterior cerebral artery
        - Middle cerebral artery
        - Posterior cerebral artery
        - Superior cerebellar artery
        - Pontine arteries
        - Anterior inferior cerebellar artery
        - Vertebral artery
        - Posterior inferior cerebellar artery

**Cortical Vascular Territories:**
![[Pasted image 20240430201015.png]]![[Pasted image 20240430201143.png]]
- Specific brain regions (cortical territories) are supplied by dedicated arteries from the Circle of Willis.
- These territories have defined boundaries with minimal overlap.
- This specific blood supply is important for neuroimaging techniques.
