### Introduction to Sleep

- **Universal behavior:** Found in almost all animals, even fruit flies exhibit periods of quiescence.
- **Innate:** We are born with the ability to sleep; it doesn't require learning.
- **Key characteristics:**
    - Low motor activity: Postural muscles are relaxed.
    - Low sensory reactivity: Less responsive to external stimuli.
    - Reversible: Can be easily awakened.

### Types of Sleep

- **Slow-wave sleep (SWS):**
    - Neocortex is "offline": Engaged in synchronized, slow wave activity.
    - Reduced information processing due to repetitive brain wave pattern.
- **Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep:**
    - Neocortex appears awake: Active brain activity similar to waking state.
    - Motor neurons inhibited: Prevents physical action despite active brain.
    - Associated with dreaming: More frequent and vivid dream recall upon waking from REM sleep.

### REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

- **Symptom:** Acting out dreams due to lack of motor neuron inhibition during REM sleep.
- **Characteristics:** Primarily affects middle-aged men.
- **Consequences:** Disruptive to both the individual and their bed partner.
- **Association:** Often linked to underlying neurodegenerative disorders.

### Sleep Architecture

- **Sleep cycle:** Alternating periods of SWS and REM sleep throughout the night.
- **SWS depth:** Increases initially and then decreases towards morning.
- **REM duration:** Short at the beginning of sleep, increasing in length as the night progresses.
