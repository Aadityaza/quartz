## Lecture Notes: Homeostasis

### Introduction to Homeostasis

- **Definition:** Homeostasis is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment within physiological limits.
- **Key parameters:** Body temperature, blood glucose levels, hydration, energy balance, and growth.
- **Voluntary actions:** While often perceived as automatic, conscious behaviors significantly contribute to homeostasis.

### Overview 

- **Classical homeostasis:** Focus on the hypothalamus and its role in maintaining bodily equilibrium.
- **Modern perspective:** Exploration of less traditional aspects of homeostasis, including its connection to disorders like postpartum depression.
- **Examples of homeostasis:** Thermoregulation, urination, breathing, and sleep-wake cycles.
- **Involvement of multiple systems:** The interplay between autonomic nervous system, skeletal muscles, mood, and motivation in maintaining homeostasis.
- **Historical context:** Walter Cannon's "The Wisdom of the Body" as a foundational work in homeostasis.
