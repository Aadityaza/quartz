    - How light enters the eye
    - The retina and initial processing
    - Pathways for interpreting visual information (what and where)
    - How we learn to see

**II. Visual Field**
![[Pasted image 20240326130856.png]]

- Binocular field: Overlap between the visual information received by both eyes. This is the majority of the visual field.
- Monocular field: Crescent-shaped areas on the far left and right of vision where information is only received by one eye.

**III. Light Entering the Eye**

- The lecture will discuss how light interacts with the eye:
    - Cornea: Transparent front layer that bends light
    - Lens: Focuses light onto the retina
    - Retina: Light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye

**IV. Brain Processing**

- The lecture will illustrate the pathway visual information takes through the brain:
    - Optic nerves: Transmit information from the eye
    - Optic chiasm: Where some nerve fibers may cross
    - Primary visual cortex: Located in the occipital lobe, responsible for initial processing
    - Two processing streams:
        - Dorsal stream ("where" pathway): Analyzes location, movement, and direction of objects
        - Ventral stream ("what" pathway): Identifies and recognizes objects
