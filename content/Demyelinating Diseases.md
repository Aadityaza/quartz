Key Ideas:

1. Types of Demyelinating Diseases:
   - Demyelinating diseases can affect either the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS), depending on the type of glial cell involved in myelination.
   - Central demyelinating diseases primarily involve oligodendrocytes and are exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common CNS demyelinating disease.
   - Peripheral demyelinating diseases involve Schwann cells and include hereditary neuropathies like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and acute inflammatory conditions like Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.

2. Symptoms of Demyelination:
   - Demyelination disrupts the neural code, leading to symptoms based on the affected axons.
   - In the PNS, motor symptoms predominate due to the involvement of fast-conducting motor axons.
   - In the CNS, symptoms vary depending on the specific axons affected by demyelination, leading to diverse clinical presentations in conditions like MS.

3. Individual Variation in Symptoms:
   - While certain axonal groups may be more commonly affected in MS, there is variability in symptom manifestation among individuals.
   - MS disrupts the neural code at a fundamental level, but the resulting symptoms are unique to each affected individual.

4. Clarification of CNS and PNS:
   - The next module will delve deeper into the differences between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
