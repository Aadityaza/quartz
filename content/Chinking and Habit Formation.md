### Chunking: Combining Actions

- **Chunking:** The process of grouping multiple actions into a single, automated sequence.
    - Increases speed and efficiency of task completion.
    - Reduces cognitive load.
    - Examples: brushing teeth, driving, scanning faces.

### Habits: Automatic Chunked Actions

- **Habits:** Chunked actions that become automatic and independent of outcomes.
    - Advantages: Fast and efficient.
    - Disadvantages: Inflexible and difficult to change.
    - Example: Drug addiction.

### Key Points

- Operational learning establishes connections between stimuli, actions, and outcomes.
- Chunking builds upon these connections to create complex behaviors.
- Habits are highly chunked behaviors that can be both beneficial and detrimental.
- Understanding chunking and habit formation is essential for understanding human behavior and developing effective interventions.
