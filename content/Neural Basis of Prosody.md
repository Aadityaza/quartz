- **Semantics:** The literal meaning of words. Primarily processed in the left hemisphere.
- **Prosody:** The vocal aspects of language, including pitch, intonation, stress, rhythm, and tempo.

### The Role of Prosody in Communication

- **Complementary to Semantics:** Prosody enriches language comprehension and expression.
- **Non-verbal cues:** Body language, facial expressions, and context also contribute significantly to understanding.
- **Example:** The movie "Les Triplettes de Belleville" demonstrates effective communication without relying solely on language.

### Neural Basis of Prosody

- **Right Hemisphere Dominance:** Similar to the language centers in the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere houses regions dedicated to prosody.
- **Wernicke's Area Equivalent:** Responsible for comprehending the emotional content of speech.
- **Broca's Area Equivalent:** Responsible for producing prosody and emotional expression in speech.

### Impact of Prosody Impairment

- **Social Difficulties:** Damage to prosody-related areas can lead to challenges in social interactions due to difficulty understanding and expressing emotions.
- **Misinterpretation:** Inability to read emotional cues can lead to misunderstandings.
- **Isolation:** Social withdrawal may occur as a result of communication breakdowns.

### Example: Jabberwocky

- A recitation of Jabberwocky with strong prosody demonstrates how emotional content can be conveyed without relying heavily on semantic meaning.

### Conclusion

- Prosody is a crucial component of communication, complementing semantics.
- The right hemisphere plays a vital role in processing and producing prosody.
- Impairment in prosody can significantly impact social interactions and overall well-being.
