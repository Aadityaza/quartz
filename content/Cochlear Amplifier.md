**Problem 1: Weak Signal**

- Sound waves lose intensity as they travel through the middle ear and inner ear.
- Without amplification, the signal reaching the hair cells would be very weak.

**Problem 2: Frequency Discrimination**

- The cochlea acts as a prism, separating frequencies but not with high enough precision.
- We need a finer distinction between similar frequencies for accurate sound perception.

**Solution: The Cochlear Amplifier**

- This mechanism in the inner ear amplifies sound waves and refines frequency discrimination.
- It is not present in dead cochleas, highlighting its active biological function.

**Next Steps:**

- The next lecture will explore how the cochlear amplifier works.
