**Key Points:**

- **Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia:** These two brain structures are involved in movement but have distinct roles.
- **Information Processing:** Both receive significantly more input than output, but the cerebellum handles raw sensory data while the basal ganglia process information filtered by the cortex.
- **Movement Control:** The cerebellum is involved in all movements, regardless of importance, while the basal ganglia focuses on goal-oriented, significant movements.
- **Higher Functions:** Emerging evidence suggests the cerebellum might also be involved in higher functions like emotions and thoughts, potentially contributing to conditions like substance abuse.

**Contrast Between Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia:**

| Feature          | Cerebellum                                                       | Basal Ganglia                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Input            | Raw sensory data (proprioception, etc.)                          | Cortically filtered information    |
| Role in Movement | Involved in all movements                                        | Focused on goal-oriented movements |
| Higher Functions | Potential involvement in emotions, thoughts, and substance abuse | Primarily involved in movement     |

**Overall, while the cerebellum is essential for basic motor control, the basal ganglia seems to play a more significant role in planning and executing complex, goal-directed actions.**
