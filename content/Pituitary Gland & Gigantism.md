### Growth Hormone

- **Production:** Controlled by the hypothalamus, growth hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland.
- **Release pattern:** Typically released in pulses during sleep, stimulating growth until the end of adolescence.

### Growth Hormone Disorders

- **Pituitary tumors:** Can lead to overproduction of growth hormone.
    - **Gigantism:** Excessive growth before puberty.
    - **Acromegaly:** Abnormal growth of hands, feet, and facial features after puberty.
- **Acromegaly symptoms:** Gradual onset over about 12 years, characterized by:
    - Increased chest size
    - Enlarged brow and lower jaw
    - Underbite
- **Treatment challenges:**
    - Pituitary gland's location at the base of the brain makes surgery difficult.
    - Accidental damage to other pituitary cells can cause severe side effects like insatiable appetite.
