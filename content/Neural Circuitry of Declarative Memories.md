### Introduction

- The study of neural circuitry underlying declarative memories began in the 1950s.
- This field was significantly influenced by the case of a single patient, HM.

### The Case of HM

- **Patient:** Henry Molaison, referred to as HM.
- **Condition:** Suffered from severe, incapacitating seizures throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.
- **Treatment:** Underwent surgery to remove the part of the brain causing seizures.
- **Surgical Procedure:** Removal of the anterior portion of the temporal lobe on both sides of the brain.
- **Outcome:** Developed dense amnesia, unable to form new memories after the surgery.

### Impact of HM's Case

- **Collaboration:** William Scoville (surgeon) and Brenda Milner (neuroscientist) collaborated to study HM.
- **Landmark Finding:** Bilateral hippocampal removal prevents the formation of declarative memories.
- **Continued Research:** Suzanne Corkin, a student of Brenda Milner, extensively studied HM's memory functions for decades.
- **Publication:** Corkin wrote "Permanent Present Tense," detailing her work with HM.

### Significance of HM's Contribution

- HM's willingness to participate in research despite his condition was invaluable.
- His case provided profound insights into memory formation and retrieval.
- HM's personality is described as affable, with a dry sense of humor and a generous spirit.
