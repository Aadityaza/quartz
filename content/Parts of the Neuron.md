1. Parts of Neurons: Neurons consist of four main parts, each with specific functions:
   - [[Cell Body (Soma)]]
     - Central part of the neuron containing the nucleus and DNA, akin to "city hall" issuing orders.
     - Manufacturing plant for proteins and energy production, vital for cell function and maintenance.
   - [[Dendrites]]
     - Branching extensions from the cell body responsible for gathering information.
     - Function as the ears or sentries of the neuron, receiving incoming signals.
	     **Dendritic Arbor**: Dendrites form a branching structure termed the dendritic arbor or dendritic tree, enhancing their capacity to gather information.

   - [[Axon]]
     - Single long projection responsible for transmitting processed information to distant locations.
     - Can extend over significant distances, up to a meter or more.
	     **Axonal Function:** Axons transmit processed information over long distances, facilitating communication between neurons and other cell types.
   - [[Synaptic Terminals]]
     - Communication centers located at the end of axons.
     - Transfer information to the next cell via synapses, which are specialized junctions.
	     Synaptic Transmission: Synaptic terminals facilitate the transfer of information to the next cell via specialized junctions called synapses.
  


**Cellular Communication:** Neurons communicate with various cell types, including other neurons, muscles, glands, and cardiac muscle, through synaptic transmission.

Diversity of Neurons: Neurons exhibit significant variability in their appearance and function, even within the same region of the nervous system.
