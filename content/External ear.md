**Main Function:**

- Gather sound waves and increase their intensity, especially for frequencies in the speech range.

**Parts:**

- Pinna: The visible part of the ear that collects sound waves from all directions.
- Auditory Canal: The tube that channels the sound waves to the eardrum.

**How it Works:**

- The pinna funnels sound waves into the auditory canal.
- The shape of the canal amplifies certain frequencies through constructive interference.
- Overall, the external ear boosts the intensity of sound waves before they reach the eardrum.

**Additional Points:**

- This amplification is not uniform across all frequencies. Speech frequencies are specifically enhanced, while other frequencies are dampened.
- This initial processing prepares the sound waves for the middle ear, where some sound energy will inevitably be lost.

**Conclusion:**

The external ear acts as a funnel and amplifier, particularly for sounds important for speech perception.
