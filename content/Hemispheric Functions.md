This lecture focused on the **primary sensory and motor areas** of the cerebral cortex. Here's a summary of the key points:
![[Pasted image 20240315203635.png]]
- **Location:**
    
    - The brain is divided into two hemispheres (left and right).
    - The lecture focused on the left hemisphere for illustration.
- **Primary Motor Cortex (M1):**
    
    - Located in the frontal lobe, in a strip anterior to the central sulcus.
    - Controls voluntary movements on the **opposite side** of the body.
    - For example, the left M1 controls the right hand.
- **Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1):**
    
    - Located posterior to the central sulcus in the parietal lobe.
    - Receives sensory information from the **opposite side** of the body.
    - For example, the left S1 receives touch information from the right hand.
- **Special Cases:**
    
    - **Auditory Cortex (A1):** Located in the temporal lobe.
        - Receives input from **both ears**, with a slight bias towards the opposite ear.
    - **Visual Cortex(V1):** Located mostly on the medial surface of the occipital lobe.
        - Receives information from the **opposite visual field**.
        - So, the left visual cortex sees everything on the right side of the world, regardless of which eye it originates from.
- **Hemispheric Specialization:**
    
    - The sensory and motor cortices are mostly **contra-lateralized**.
    - This means one hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body.
    - However, there are exceptions for auditory and visual processing.
- **Language Lateralization:**
    
    - Language processing is primarily located in the **left hemisphere**.
    - Damage to the left hemisphere can lead to aphasia, a language disorder.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions Brodmann areas for each region, but doesn't go into detail. You can find more information about these Brodmann areas in resources on cortical organization.
