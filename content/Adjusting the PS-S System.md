**Lecture Summary:**

- This lecture discusses the pharmacology of the autonomic nervous system, which is involved in regulating various bodily functions.
- Drugs are used to treat conditions by mimicking or blocking the effects of neurotransmitters in the autonomic nervous system.

**Key Points:**

- **Autonomic nervous system:**
    - Composed of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
    - Regulates involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion, and gland secretions.
- **Neurotransmitters:**
    - Acetylcholine (ACh) is used in both systems:
        - Pre-ganglionic neurons in both systems use ACh.
        - Parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons use ACh.
    - Norepinephrine (NE) is used in the sympathetic system post-ganglionic neurons.
- **Receptors:**
    - Nicotinic ACh receptors: Fast-acting, located in ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic).
    - Muscarinic ACh receptors: Slow-acting, located in parasympathetic effector organs (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands).
    - Adrenergic receptors: Slow-acting, located in sympathetic effector organs (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands).
        - Alpha and beta subtypes exist.
- **Drugs:**
    - **Mimic neurotransmitters:** agonists (e.g., drugs mimicking ACh at muscarinic receptors).
    - **Block neurotransmitters:** antagonists (e.g., beta-blockers that block beta-adrenergic receptors).
- **Effects of drugs:**
    - Parasympathomimetic/parasympatholytic drugs generally have no direct effect on the brain.
    - Sympathomimetic/sympatholytic drugs can have central nervous system effects and affect mood or motivation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The lecture mentions specific examples of drugs but doesn't delve into their details.
- The lecture emphasizes the slow, indirect nature of autonomic effects compared to the fast actions of the skeletal motor system.
