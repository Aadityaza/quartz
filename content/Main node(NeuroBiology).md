**Introduction:**
The lecture explores the concept of locked-in syndrome through the experience of Jean Dominique Bauby, shedding light on the four basic functions of the brain and the central nervous system.

**Outline of the Lecture:**
1. Voluntary Movement
2. Perception vs. Sensation
3. Homeostasis
4. Abstract or Higher Functions (Cognition)

**Key Concepts and Definitions:**
- Locked-In Syndrome: A condition where a person is conscious but unable to move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis.
- Central Nervous System: The brain and spinal cord, responsible for processing and transmitting information.

**Main Points and Supporting Details:**

1. **Voluntary Movement**  
   - Definition: Actions driven by the brain, ranging from deliberate gestures to emotional responses.
   - Examples: Raising a hand, wincing in pain, speaking, writing, facial expressions.
   - Illustration: Bauby's loss of voluntary movement, limited to eye blinking.

2. **Perception vs. Sensation**  
   - Perception: Conscious appreciation of sensory input.
   - Sensation: Sensory input received by the brain, not necessarily consciously perceived.
   - Examples: Vision, hearing, smell, taste, sense of balance, position, and equilibrium.

3. **Homeostasis**  
   - Definition: Maintenance of physiological balance within the body.
   - Factors: Oxygen delivery, blood pressure regulation, body temperature control.
   - Challenges: Life cycle events, daily rhythms, seasonal variations.

4. **Abstract or Higher Functions (Cognition)**  
   - Definition: Complex mental processes including thinking, emotions, motivation, language, memory, learning, and social interaction.
   - Importance: Integral to human behavior and interaction.

**Note from Lecture on Brain Functions Mapping and Central Nervous System**

**Introduction:**
In this segment, the lecture focuses on mapping the four basic functions of the brain onto the central nervous system. 
- It explores the regions of the brain responsible for 
	- voluntary movement
	- perception
	- homeostasis
	- and higher abstract functions.

**Main Points and Supporting Details:**

1. **Mapping Functions onto the Central Nervous System**  
   - The forebrain, which encompasses the cerebral cortex, is distinguished from the brain stem and spinal cord.

2. **Voluntary Movements**  (BS, SC)
   - Motor neurons, responsible for voluntary muscle movements, are located in the **brain stem and spinal cord, not in the forebrain**.
   - Motor neurons in the brain stem control facial expressions, speech, and swallowing, while those in the spinal cord govern movement of the limbs and trunk.

3. **Perception**  (FB)
   - Perception, the conscious appreciation of sensory inputs, relies entirely on the **forebrain**, particularly the cerebral cortex.
   - The lecturer emphasizes the significance of the cerebral cortex in sensory perception.

4. **Homeostasis**  (FB,BS,SC)
   - Homeostasis, the maintenance of physiological balance, involves contributions from the **forebrain, brain stem, and spinal cord.**
   - Hormonal regulation occurs in the forebrain, while the brain stem and spinal cord contribute through autonomic changes and conscious movements.

5. **Higher Abstract Functions**  (FB)
   - Higher abstract functions, including language, memory, emotion, and thought, are **exclusively dependent on the forebrain**, particularly the cerebral cortex.
   - The lecturer underscores the critical role of the forebrain in facilitating complex cognitive processes.

**Summary:**
The forebrain is primarily responsible for higher cognitive functions, while the brain stem and spinal cord play essential roles in motor control and homeostasis.

### The Neocortex as Interpreter

- The neocortex is responsible for interpreting events, including those related to the body.
- Disease and illness are interpreted uniquely by individuals.
- Even with complete knowledge of a disease, predicting its impact on a specific person is impossible.

### Personalizing Disease Experience

- Personal experiences with disease can vary widely.
- Examples:
    - Stroke: Some individuals view it as a positive life change.
    - Parkinson's Disease: Some individuals report personal growth and increased empathy.
    - Terminal Illness: The desire for control and autonomy often outweighs physical pain.

### The Power of the Neocortex

- The neocortex assigns meaning to experiences.
- Individual differences in the neocortex lead to unique interpretations.
- The human experience is shaped by both biology and personal perspective.
